Files for the 2025 URPS project "Forecasting Solar Flares with Deep Time Series Models"

Before submitting any Slurm job (a file whose extension is `.sbat`) on Great Lakes, make sure to do the following:

- Insert the line `export SBATCH_ACCOUNT=YOUR_ACCOUNT` in `~/.bashrc`, with the account that resources should be charged to in the place of `YOUR_ACCOUNT`.
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` at the command line.
